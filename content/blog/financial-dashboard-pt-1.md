It's been awhile since my last post, but I wanted to write about my most recent project that I am working on. 

## #Adulting

Recently, my [wife](https://www.sanchezvisualarts.com/) and I have been looking for houses here in North Carolina. The market for homes is favorable, especially for first time home buyers with average credit, so we're pretty motivated. This has prompted us to take our finances more seriously, and monitor our spending. We laid out a budget, and planned to save accordingly for this purchase. While there exists software already to help track these kind of things, I figured it would be a good exercise to try to build my own.

I am going to use this opportunity to traverse the full development stack.

Below is the list of technologies I will be using:

>
### Database/ORM - PostgreSQL/EntityFramework
> <a href="#">Coming Soon!</a>
### Backend - C# .NET Core
> <a href="#">Coming Soon!</a>
### UI Design - Adobe XD
> <a href="#">Coming Soon!</a>
### UI Library - React
> <a href="#">Coming Soon!</a>
### State Management - Redux
> <a href="#">Coming Soon!</a>

I'll keep posting about my progress on each layer, and hopefully learn a lot along the way. And if you find any of these helpful, feel free to let me know! Even if you didn't find it helpful and you think I'm an idiot, I'd love to learn more for all the experienced people online.
